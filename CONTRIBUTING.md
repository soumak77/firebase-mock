# Contributing

* Fork the repo
* `npm install`
* make your additions in `./src`
* Do not edit the files in `./browser`. They are built automatically for releases. [@bendrucker](https://github.com/bendrucker) will have to spend time rebasing your PR and that makes him :cry:.
* add test units in `./test`
* `npm test`
* submit a pull request when all tests pass
